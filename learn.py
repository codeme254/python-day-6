#PYTHON FUNCTIONS
# built in functions -> sum() int() str() input() print() len() etc
# our own functions:
def my_function():
    print("Hello")
    print("Bye")

# triggering the function/ calling the function to do what we want
my_function()

# the while loop: the loop that continues going until a certain condition is met
